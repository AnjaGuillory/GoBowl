# Test Plan

*This is the template for your test plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

**Author**: \<person or team name\>

| Version | Description     |
| --------|:---------------:|
| V1      | Initial version |
*In case you revise this document in later deliverables, increase the version number and concisely describe what you modified. For example:*

| *Version* | *Description*       | 
| ----------|:-------------------:|
| *V1*      | *Initial version*   |
| *V2*      | *Updated Sections 2 and 3 basd on better understanding of the system* |
| *...*     | *...*               |

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

*This section should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing, regression testing) and who will perform such activities.*

### 1.2 Test Selection

*Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

*Define how you are going to assess the quality of your test cases. Typically, this involves some form of functional or structural coverage. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

*Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.*

### 1.5 Technology

*Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).*

## 2 Test Cases

*This section should be the core of this document and should list the set of tests that you are planning to perform to assess the quality of the system you are developing. Normally, for system tests, this section would consists of a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide:*

- *its purpose*
- *the steps necessary to perform the test*
- *the expected result*
- *the actual result (to be filled later)*
- *pass/fail information (to be filled later)*
- *any additional information you think is relevant*

*In case your team used some form of automated system testing, you can simply commit your tests so that they can be run automatically and replace the entries in the table for "steps necessary to perform the test", "expected result", and "actual result" with information on how to run the tests.*

*If your team developed automated (e.g., JUnit) unit test cases in addition to the system test cases, you should commit them so that they can be run automatically and mention how to run them. You do not need to list unit test cases in the table.*
