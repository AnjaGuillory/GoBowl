## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy


The Go Bowl application will initially be developed with system and unit testing.  Integration testing and regression testing will possibly be added in a future deliverable.  Deliverable 2 will define a sample of initial system tests attempting to cover most use cases.  Initial unit test will be pursued in deliverable 3.


### 1.2 Test Selection

Initally the functional (black box) testing will be performed with unit testing defined in a future deliverable.


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

Test coverage will be used to examine the quality of tests in future iterations.


### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs encountered in development will be processed by the team as testing development progresses.  Email communication will allow team members to relay information in short time.

### 1.5 Technology

Android, JUnit tests, automated integration tests if time permits.
